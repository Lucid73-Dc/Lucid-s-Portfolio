<h1>About Me</h1>
 <p>Am Prince,from Nigeria born on the 14th of March 2005.</p>
 <p>As a beginner in web development,i felt like an explorer stepping into a vast and uncharted digital world. The initial days were both
 thrilling and overwelming . HTML was my first language, and learning to structure a webpage felt like the foundation of a house.
 I marveled at how simple tags could transform a blank screen into something meaningful.</p>

<p> Also as a beginner who is still learning web development , everday feels like a new chapter in an exciting journey.
 I'm constantly discovering tools,techniques, and concept that make me realise how much there is to learn. At times, it feels
 overwelming, but the sense of progress keeps me motivated.
 
<p> My first steps were learning the basics of HTML,and i quickly understood its role as the backbone of any webpage.Writing 
 simple code to creat a headings, paragraph,and links felt empowering, even if it was just a basic page with plain text and i know
 i have a loong way to go . but everyline of code i write and every problem i solve gives me a sense of achivevement. It's not just about building
 websites;it's about building confidence and mindset that welcomes challenges.Am excited to keep learning,one step at a time.</p>
